This is a project to study Knn algorithm in pyhton. I used Iris flower dataset since it is easily understandable and relatively small. 

So far, 

- I implemented Knn with respective python functions in iris_flower_classification.py file.
- I implemented a Knn class with the code of algorithm itself in python in KNN.py file.
